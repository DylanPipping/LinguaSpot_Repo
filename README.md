Project: LinguaSpot

Developer: Dylan Pipping

End date prototype 1.0: 03-07-2023

Summary:
This project was made during the internship from February till the end of June. The project was made in partnership with the Stakeholder Marja Vermunt and was made for students in the NT2 education. The project is concepted as a simulation game that allows the player to play as an customer in a supermarket. In this supermarket the player is supposed to buy groceries, but due to the player being a NT2 student he/she is not yet proficiant in dutch they don't now where everything is at/don't know what certain product are called. Therefore there is a employee working in this supermarket that can help the player by guiding he/she through the store. By talking to the employee the player can practice their conversation skills in dutch and get a feel how it for a majority feels like shopping in a store.

The game was setup using unity and uses tools such as ReadyPlayerMe for character avatar making and chatGPT for the conversation/dialogue with the supermarket employee.

Future development:

So far most of the project was focussed more on the dialogue and chatGPT for the game. There is a minimal enviroment set up, but this for the most is still rather empty by the time of making this readme. Therefore my advice for the person picking up this project for potential future development of the project would be to research more into the dialogue system with chatGPT. This is because as off writing this readme there is not much on the use for chatGPT in the NT2 education. This was concluded after tests with students where it was shown that the prompts used (prompted for the AI to respond on a elementary school level dutch) where still to advanced for the type of education in the NT2. Therefore with the thought of there potentially being more information with chatGPT in NT2 education, the research can advance from that point and give a better prototype. Also the enviroment could also be improved if it benifits the end result.

If by any change more information is needed, feel free to contact me.
